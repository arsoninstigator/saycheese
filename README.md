## inspiration and comments
i was rewatching harry potter the other day and suddenly had the urge to make a basic html/css portfolio while pretending to be someone studying the dark arts at hogwarts.  
<br> <br>
the worst part is that the website actually looked decent in step one (see below) but i had to cut down information and text and code to make it less than 2500 characters so that it could be fit into it and made into a scannable qr code 
<br><br>
i had so much fun learning about the concept of data uris and feel like this ysws had its own unique appeal since it required some practical application and still have some basic theoretical knowledge of the working of qr codes, something we've come to see everywhere in our daily lives. the behind-the-scenes experience was fun and i hope so see more future ysws's of this variant

## the building process

1. make the portfolio website in html & css
2. cut down a lot of extra content
3. minify the html file using [this](https://www.minifier.org/html-minifier )
4. convert html to base 64 data uri using [this](https://base64.guru/converter/encode/html)
5. cut down more content
6. make sure it's approx 2kb or under
7. generate a qr code using [this](https://qrcode.tec-it.com/en)
