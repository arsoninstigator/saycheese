I was rewatching Harry Potter the other day and suddenly had the urge to make a HTML/CSS portfolio in first-person as someone studying the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. Shenanigans Ensue.

# building process
1. make the portfolio website in html & css
2. cut down a lot of extra content
3. minify the html file
4. convert html to base 64 data uri
5. make sure it's approx 2kb or under
6. generate a qr code
